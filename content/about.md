hi there! 

I recently finished my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Toronto Metropolitan University.

I am currently working at LDA Technologies, where I am developing internal tooling to help my coworkers and customers have a beautiful and intuitive user experience with our products.

I have 16 months of internship experience at Geotab, split over two teams and two projects. 

My strongest languages are Go, Python and Java although I am currently learning Zig and maybe Rust in the near future.  

In my free time, I like to explore concepts related to distributed systems. You can read about some of my learnings and side projects on [my blog](/blog).

Some of my current interests and hobbies include following the AI industry, running, watching UFC and F1, [photography](/photography) and travel.
