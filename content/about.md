Hello! I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from **Toronto Metropolitan University**, where I graduated with distinction. I am a passionate software developer eager to contribute my skills to a new team, with a particular interest in backend systems and developer tools.

My experience includes **16 months of internship work at Geotab**, where I rotated through two distinct roles.

I spent the majority of my time as a **Tools Developer**, where I designed and built a Python CLI tool. This tool was essential for transforming raw vehicle data into formats used by various internal teams, allowing me to gain experience with **Python, Protobuf and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

Later, I transitioned to a **Backend Developer** role for four months. This was a valuable opportunity to witness firsthand what it takes to scale a high-traffic backend system. In this role, I worked with technologies like **C#, Docker, Redis, Kubernetes, and Terraform** to help the team handle hundreds of requests per second.
